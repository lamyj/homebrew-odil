# Odil installation on macOS via homebrew

This [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) formula is an easy way to install [Odil](https://odil.readthedocs.io) on macOS. If Homebrew is not yet installed on your system, refer to their [official documentation](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation). 

You then need to add the Odil tap to Homebrew:
```
brew tap lamyj/odil
```

Once Homebrew and this tap are configured, you can install Odil:
```
brew install odil
```
